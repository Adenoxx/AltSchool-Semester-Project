ALTSCHOOL SECOND SEMESTER PROJECT

This is a simple web app to fetch the github repository of any user using GitHub API with pagination enabled

I utilized ReactQuery to integrate GitHub API, Vite and tailwind CSS for layout and design. I also used ReactRouter6 to show repo pages.

To complete this project I had to do lots of research in addition to what I have been taught @AltSchool Africa, though I have not gotten a hang of react yet, this has been a eye opener.

GUIDE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PAGE:

1. Enter your username in the search field and your details will be displayed.
2. Click on your username in the display to see a list of all your repositories.
3. Click on view to see data/content of each repository.


There you have it. Your GitHub Web App!!!
