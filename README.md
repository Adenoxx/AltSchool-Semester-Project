ALTSCHOOL SECOND SEMESTER PROJECT
This is a simple web app to fetch the github repository of any user using GitHub API.

I utilized ReactQuery to integrate GitHub API, Vite and tailwind CSS.

To complete this project I had to do lots of research in addition to  what I have been taught in AltSchool, though I have not gotten a hang of react yet, this has been a eye opener.

I used ReactRouter6 to show repo pages
